# STATUS

Each autonomous dev cycle appends one dated `##` section here describing
only what it verified this cycle (facts, test results, exact next slice).
Do not rewrite older sections.

> Older cycle history lives in `docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md`. Only search it
> when tracking a specific past bug; do not read it by default.

Keep this file small: wire `scripts/compact_status.py` into a frequently
running read-only job (e.g. a progress-report cron) so it archives old
sections into `docs/STATUS_HISTORY.md` automatically once this file grows
past ~16KB. See `docs/TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md` for the full pattern.
